# Deep Learning

This repository aims at gathering all my Deep Learning projects. I'm a Deep Learning enthusiast and I love working on this projects that help me get a better grasp at this intricate topic. I have been working mainly on NLP, which is also something I find fascinating within the world of DL, and Machine Learning in general. It's also more closely related to my current job as well.

In this repo you will find:
* A Kaggle folder with some of my work in NLP using Deep Learning
* An MNIST folder playing around with the MNIST dataset and autoencoders to use vector representations to "create" mixed numbers
* A masters folder that contains most of the exercices for DL we used during my masters degree
* A few extra files that don't belong to any of those
